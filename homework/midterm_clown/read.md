Title: Clown

Explanation:
 My motivation for making this project is to explore the code we learned so far. I wanted to make something fun, possibly directed towards children. My project can be displayed somewhere in a carnival, or possible on a virtual invitation to a circus. The inputs include
 1. number of balls--> that number of images of the ball displays
 2. juggle --> balls rotate
 3. hover --> hat goes on clown
 4. unicycle button --> image of the clown on a UNICYCLE
 5. go button --> the wheel moves
