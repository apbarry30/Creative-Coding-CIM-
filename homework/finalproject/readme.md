Title: Eat or be Eaten

Explanation:
 My motivation for making this project is to explore the code we learned this semester. I wanted to make something that included animals, was directed towards children, educational and fun. The collide library interested me because I wanted to make a game that involved what animals eat. My project can be displayed somewhere in museum  or website covering the cycle of life of animals. The inputs include
 1. choose character--> changes the character in the game
 2. instruction button --> shows instructions
 3. Start/Restart --> starts the game
 4. Collection of "food" --> makes your score increase/speed of player and the hawk also increases
 5. Collide with the hawk --> sound plays "YOU LOSE"
