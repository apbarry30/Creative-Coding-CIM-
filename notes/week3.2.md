create a character or a piece of art with the shapes we learned in class
use 5 variables within your character
homework 2 on github

var charColor= orange
fill (charColor)
if there is repitition in the code, you should use a variable
replace numbers with variables, face positions

function draw() {
  facePosX = mouseX;
  facePosY = mouseY;

  moves with the cursor ^

  need a procure that instead of stamping every time,
  it will give us a fresh canvas and then a stamp
  add another background functin to fix this

  another interactive function: when the mouse gets pressed, then you can do something
  function mousePressed(); {

  }
  change value of charColor based on the mouse mousePressed

  inclass notes theres a section called copywrite where there are code open source images in which you are able to use 
  openclipart.org
  the noun project.com (SVG)


  preload goes before the setup- used for uploading images and video
  things that take long you want to upload before the project starts
  load it, then i want to use it
  recommend using pngs over jpegs because you can add transparency (no white box behind)
  image (what image you want to output, followed by the position)
