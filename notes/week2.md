p5js

all code goes in the sketch under empty examples

have one copy of it in hw and one copy in the notes section

whenever you create a new homework assignment - have a copy in your homework file as well as your notes

html has a tree structure (head tag/body)

headtag would include things preprocessed by the browser
-occastional (script tag) inside the body
style tag

script tags ; first script allows you to link p5js library
../ means go up a directory
needs to go back to the main folder to find the p5js file
addsons ../addons - how you install a library
sketch.js

a function is a block of code that runs when its called
p5js looks first for the setup function and runs and then the draw function
setup code runs once, sets up variables/size of canvas/ color
then enters the draw loop (loop that runs your code in order)

create canvas is a function - we always have to give it a dimension/size based off pixels
parameters are the building blocks that help a function exist

background takes a greyscale value (range from 0-255)
0 is black and 255 is white
color can be RGB (255,0,0) gives you red. 0,0,255 gives you blue
you can represent color by words ("brown")- in quotes
(#333333) HEX colors 6 digit

can go to reference and look at the background section on the p5 site

stick with web color, rgb, naming the color or HEX

drawing
always references the top left corner (0,0) origin point
computer then breaks up the entire screen into individual pixels
-that is your grid where you are going to draw things

an elipse draws based on its center point - then you need to give it a width in size
-the diameter will be 10 if you put in 10. across the center point that you wrote (radius of 5)
takes x, y, and width and height

rectangle position (20.20)- bases off the upper left hand corner
10 pixels x 10 pixels will be drawn based off of your point
(10 across and 10 down) then width and height
