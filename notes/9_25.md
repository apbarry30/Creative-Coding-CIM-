arrays
var posX = [numbers in array]
var posX = [0,100,200];
to access posX [0] - put postiion in the brackets
var posX [position0, position1, position2]

posX [1] is equal to 100
when user types in 10, now the daynd night 2 will generate the position first and then in the draw loop just show me those 10 new positions over and over again static where they are 
instead of randomly placing them in 10 positions and keep doing that over and over.
